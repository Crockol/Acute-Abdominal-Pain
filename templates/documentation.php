Acute abdominal pain (AAP) is a medical emergency, characterized by undiagnosed pain persisting for less than 1 week.<br>
In a previous report from the United States about 8% of the total Emergency Department (ED) visits, were characterized by abdominal pain as the chief complaint at entry.<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ahcd/nhamcs_emergency/2011_ed_web_tables.pdf">(1)</a><br>
AAP recognizes a variety of potential etiologies, ranging from self-limiting disorders to life-threatening conditions.<br> 
Although the majority of patients have minor conditions, failure to identify and treat patients with serious illnesses may result in serious consequences.<a href="http://www.annemergmed.com/article/S0196-0644(00)70171-5/abstract">(2)</a></p>
<p id = c>Decision Tool</p>
<p>AAP diagnosis is often challenging and its correct management must be based on a complete history taking and physical examination.<br>
A useful policy should assist the physician in the identification of the most serious and life-threatening conditions.<br>
Indeed, despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances (computed tomography, ultrasonography, and laparoscopy), the misdiagnosis rate of the most common surgical emergency, acute appendicitis, hasn’t changed much over time. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3468117/">(3)</a><br>
It is possible to number lots of reasons for developing clinical policies in emergency medicine, as well as the approaches used in their development. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8442553">(4)</a><br>
As for AAP, making accurate decisions is difficult, in both primary and secondary care, because many conditions can concur at the same time and no single clinical finding or laboratory test is both specific and sensitive.<br>
Because of this complexity, the first thing that must be analyzed is the critical utilization of Decision Tools (DT) to deal with AAP management.<br>
A decision tool is an active knowledge resource that uses patient data to generate case-specific advice, which supports clinical decision-making about individual patients by health professionals, the patients themselves or others concerned about them.<br>
Many tools have been developed to aid the management of AAP and other conditions. Such tools have a long history, with the first computer aid developed in 1959.<br>
Some examples of decision tools include the Alvarado score and the Leeds Acute Abdominal Pain system.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62234/">(5)</a><br>
Using Alvarado score in the diagnostic protocol, leads to the prompt diagnosis and early treatment of many cases of appendicitis and can indicate the proper decision to perform computed tomography during the diagnostic process in ED.<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/9/139">(6)</a><br>
The Leeds Acute Abdominal Pain system, on the other hand, is a software-based system (AAPHelp) used as part of a full clinical evaluation.<br>
It was developed collecting data  from patients presenting with AAP to over 100 hospitals in the UK and Europe over a 15 years time span.<br>
Its accuracy depends on information assimilation, and further clinical interpretation of the results is vital.<a href="http://www.aaphelp.leeds.ac.uk/aaphelp/">(7)</a><br>
In summary the clinical performance indicators, used in all studies, showed:<br>
Improved accuracy of diagnosis of patients at presentation by 10-20%.<br>
Improved accuracy of decisions made after further investigations by 10-20%.<br>
Reduction in negative appendectomies by 5-20%.<br>
Reduction in the perforated appendix rate by 10-20%.<br>
In all the trials, which covered a variety of clinical situations, the use of AAPHelp has resulted in improvements in decision making.<br>
The improvement in clinical performance resulted in a decreased number of unnecessary admissions and operations, leading to improved patient care and better use of existing resources.</p>

<p id = c>Computerised decision support systems (CDSS)</p>
<p>CDSS are information systems designed to improve clinical decision-making.<br>
CDSS match individual patient characteristics to a computerized knowledge base, and software algorithms generate patient-specific recommendations.<br>
CDSS were widely tested during the last decades with results that were generally favorable.
Over the past several decades, the uses and applications of biomedical informatics for computer-aided medical diagnostics and decision support systems have become ubiquitous in clinical settings.<br>
A controlled prospective comparison of human and computer-aided diagnosis dealing with AAP, for instance, showed that the computing system's overall diagnostic accuracy (91·8%) was significantly higher than that of the most senior member of the clinical team (79·6%).<br>
It is suggested as a result of these studies that the provision of such a system to aid the clinician is feasible in a real-time clinical setting, and likely to be of practical value.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21045220">(8)</a><br><br>
Other studies suggested:<br> 
a) The diagnosis of acute abdominal pain by inexperienced emergency surgeons remains a difficult problem.<br>
b) Doctors who have been assisted by a computer have, in many instances, improved their diagnostic and decision-making performance.<br>
c) This improvement has not been due to superior "artificial intelligence" of the computer, but due to the computer acting as an educational focus and a stimulus to good clinical practice.<br>
d) On an international level, these studies have been immensely valuable.<br>
In addition, there is evidence that the major benefit from such diagnostic aids was the accurate early diagnosis of non-specific abdominal pain in the ED; which in turn led to fewer admissions and fewer operations with negative findings.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2497469/">(9)</a><br><br>

In the past, inception into routine clinical practice was hampered largely by the size and speed of the hardware. Computer systems are now vastly superior and the potential benefit of CDSS deserves investigation.<br>
Currently, medical devices and high-throughput measurement systems produce thousands of images and large volumes of other data per patient in seconds, making it difficult for physicians to analyze the informations while providing timely diagnoses and prognoses.<br> 
There is a present significant need for development and improvement of CDSS in medicine, with an expected amplification in the future.<br>
One of the most active research area in the realm of biomedical informatics and decision support systems is emergency medicine.<br> 
For patients in ED, it is critical that diagnosis and treatment be provided in a timely manner.<br>
CDSS play a vital role in reducing diagnosis time, improving resource allocation efficiency, and decreasing patient mortality. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23431259">(10)</a><br><br>

In conclusion, such systems are inevitably becoming an inherent part of medicine.<br>
The systems are becoming capable of solving more complex and sophisticated clinical problems. <br>
By establishing systematic processes for validation and verification, these computer-aided systems can become much more reliable and thereby improve the quality of diagnostic decisions, as well as reduce variance among physicians' opinions. <br>
The unique capabilities of these systems allow care givers and researchers to gain insight into current clinical issues in ways that would have been impossible in the past.Furthermore, while computerized diagnostic and prognostic decision support systems have proved to be instrumental in medicine, it appears that an even more significant contribution of these systems can be expected when they further evolve to process and integrate newer and even broader types of patient data.<br>
As for the management of AAP, the development of appropriate CDSS will be really favorable.<br>
